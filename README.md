# Python project template

A template for building Python projects with Poetry, configured with `pre-commit` and `black` for pre-commit hooks and auto-formatting.

## Setup

To install dependencies
```bash
poetry install --no-root
```

Then run any commands by prefixing `poetry run` e.g.,

`poetry run python main.py`
